# SCROLLRACK

As avid Magic the Gathering players, we know how a collection of cards can accumulate and blow up in proportions. Searching through your collection of thousands of cards is tedious and happens a lot if youâ€™re looking to see if you own a specific card. Cards that you forget about that may be worth something will sit without purpose until you stumble upon them way later. With ScrollRack, our intent isto provide a place where you can see your cards information and easily look through them to see what you own without you having to look one by one. With ScrollRack you can be sure what you have before you look and maybe find a little value that was sitting in the closet.
